Purpose: A gamified plastic bottle collection system which award points to the users. The points are used
         to stay at the top of leaderboard of a great community of people who help protect the world, and 
         points can also be consumed to get coupons for supported stores and marketplaces.

The program has the following core methods:

1. mainProgram: Executes the main functionalities of the program in sequence by calling other methods in
proper sequence.

2.introMsg: Initial greetings to the user.

3. userLogin: Uses ID and PIN number verification syststem. Since the system is not active, any ID of 6 
digits and PIN of 4 digits are accepted and ID number is used later on throughout the system.

3. mainMenu: At first asks the user for the type and amount of bottle to be recycled, the user can also 
skip recycling and go to the next menu. Recycling adds points to the User's ID. In this case, we have a
dummy user name 'John Doe' with the ID entered in the previous menu. After recycling, the final points
are displayed and opotions are shown for viewing the Leaderboard, getting coupons or exiting the program.

4. outroMsg: Upon exiting the program, a small message is displayed as an outro.
